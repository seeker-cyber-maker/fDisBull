# Native QEMU DOS migration

Use `dos-migration` to inspect the current slices, capability gaps and default
promotion gate. The ledger covers all current DOSBox RPC methods and public
debugger routes plus non-method surfaces. Test references are requirements,
not a claim those tests ran. DOSBox stays the default and remains selectable
after the migration; an uncertain operation never triggers an implicit fallback.

## Choose the backend explicitly

| Selector | Execution environment |
| --- | --- |
| `dosbox` | Retained patched DOSBox-X; existing COM/MZ project route |
| `dosbox-qemu` | DOSBox-X inside a prepared Linux/QEMU guest |
| `qemu-dos` | Native QEMU PC; original raw disk or original COM/MZ plus a separate DOS boot disk |
| `qemu-machine` | Existing generic raw machine and QEMM/DESQview contexts |

Native QEMU currently supplies machine controls, physical/virtual memory,
guarded edits, break/watchpoints, completed-step trace artifacts, stored PNGs
when the QEMU build supports them, and stopped memory snapshot/search/edit/rule
operations. The process slice adds real DOS EXEC loading, verified PSP/source
entry and selected-process exit/TSR observations. Frame-timed input, native
checkpoints, fetch layers, event predicates and scene parity remain later
slices. Periodic memory rules need the later
guest-clock slice; explicit stopped rule ticks are available.

## Check an installation without a game

```sh
fdisbull dos-migration
fdisbull dos-migration --surface debug-save-state
fdisbull doctor --backend qemu-dos --executable /path/to/qemu-system-x86_64 \
  --qemu-firmware /path/to/qemu/share/qemu --qemu-transport pipe \
  --output /private/qemu-core-check
```

Doctor executes authored boot code. Inspect its scope and individual checks:
it does not boot DOS or qualify drivers, checkpoints, games or timing parity.
QEMU 9.1+ is required. No custom QEMU patch is required. A minimal QEMU build
may lack stored-display capture; that capability is observed at startup.

`pipe` uses private POSIX process streams/FIFOs without a network listener.
The default `unix` transport remains available for existing environments.
Dispatched control failures are terminal when their outcome is uncertain.

## Launch a caller-owned DOS disk

Keep source disks, project databases and runtime artifacts outside Git. A
native DOS disk has complete 512-byte sectors, a boot signature and at most
64 MiB. Standard floppy sizes use A:; other sizes use the IDE disk. The basic
profile uses one 486, 32 MiB and no network. Configuration is not boot proof.

```sh
fdisbull dos-profile /private/DOS.img
fdisbull import /private/DOS.img /private/dos-native.fdb \
  --arch x86 --bits 32 --base 0 --entry 0
fdisbull debug /private/dos-native.fdb --backend qemu-dos \
  --executable /path/to/qemu-system-x86_64 --game-dir /private \
  --qemu-firmware /path/to/qemu/share/qemu --qemu-transport pipe
```

The 32-bit raw file-address view allows a whole floppy in the project; actual
instruction width comes from observed CPU state. Raw disk offsets are not a
loaded program's source addresses. The machine starts paused at reset. In the
same retained JSON server, use the returned run ID with `debug-breakpoint` at
`0x7c00`, `debug-run`, `debug-registers`, and explicitly physical/virtual
`debug-memory`. `debug-step` is one instruction boundary, without the DOSBox
count option. A data watch uses `debug-breakpoint` with `access` and `length`.

Prepared `dos-profile --cpu max --memory-mib 64` output can be supplied as the
`guest_profile` object to JSON `debug-launch`. For installed QEMM or DESQview,
select its existing pinned profile with `--guest-profile qemm` or `desqview`;
report ingestion and actual kernel compatibility remain separate evidence.

Project identity, admitted profile and private runtime copy must agree. QEMU
runs with a disposable disk snapshot over that copy, preserving the source
disk. Closing discards runtime disk changes. An explicit firmware directory is
recorded by file hashes at admission; the default firmware path is unpinned.

Use scripts with `backend: "qemu-dos"` for the supported native operations.
Unknown or unsupported operations must refuse before execution. Stored trace
completion and display-surface capture do not acquire DOSBox fetch/frame
semantics just because their method names resemble each other.

## Keep the fallback testable

Launch an original COM/MZ project explicitly with `--backend dosbox` when a
migration gap or late regression requires comparison. Retain the old executable,
its preparation recipe and native regression tests. A raw disk project and a
COM/MZ project have different address mappings; never silently convert them or
restore one emulator's checkpoint into the other.

Transfer slices in dependency order: core; DOS process/drivers; traces/events;
clock/media/input; checkpoints; layers/hooks/block services; histories;
workflows; compatibility and fallback campaigns. QEMM, DESQview, Windows and
real games each require actual runtime evidence beyond the authored snippets.
Custom hostcalls, asynchronous providers and UDL/UIL joins remain a later slice;
the native launcher does not activate the earlier experiment's opcode hooks.

## Launch an original DOS process

For an original COM/MZ project, select `qemu-dos` with a separate
`dos_boot_image`, `dos_mcopy`, `dos_startup_batch` (default `FDAUTO.BAT`) and
`dos_arguments` (literal CP437 command tail, at most 126 bytes).

```sh
fdisbull import /private/game/TARGET.COM /private/target.fdb --image com
fdisbull debug /private/target.fdb --backend qemu-dos \
  --executable /path/to/qemu-system-x86_64 --game-dir /private/game \
  --dos-boot-image /private/DOS.img --dos-mcopy /path/to/mcopy \
  --dos-startup-batch FDAUTO.BAT --dos-arguments ' ALPHA.TXT /Q' \
  --qemu-firmware /path/to/qemu/share/qemu --qemu-transport pipe
```

The startup batch must already exist and return. Staging preserves its original
bytes and CONFIG files, appends an authored loader invocation, and uses private
disk copies. Required drivers/assets must already be on the FAT12/FAT16 boot
image; no host directory is mounted. COM2 is reserved for the loader protocol.
Conflicting names, changed source/disk, patched project versions, secondary
executable formats and inconsistent observations are refused.

`debug-dos-process` returns the real PSP/parent, MCB allocation, entry registers,
initial source map, environment segment, tail/FCBs, driver-chain observations
and process lifecycle. Read `source_mapping.runtime_base` and `delta` before
placing native breakpoints: machine controls do not translate static addresses.
The entire file-backed module is verified after ordered MZ relocations and
the exact DOS startup stack writes recorded in `loader_writes`. Initial load
verification is not continuous proof after self-modification or overlay loads.

The internal parent-return breakpoint yields `guest_exit` or `guest_tsr` only
after a matching helper report and DOS return category. Nested child completion
does not complete the selected process. Resident results retain observed
allocations and vector changes, without inferring which TSR instruction ran or
claiming vector-change causation. Exit/residency changes the capture epoch;
machine close invalidates live ranges. A failed observation is not a DOS exit.
The machine remains stopped and owned after a verified return.

Entry requires observed real mode. QEMM, DESQview, DPMI and V86 combinations
remain separate qualification campaigns. A registered device header or the
authored SYS initialization test does not establish arbitrary device I/O.
Source tests require real QEMU/FreeDOS and independent authored COM/MZ/TSR
witnesses; production uses the packaged helper without requiring NASM.
